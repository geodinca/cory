By using a containment shield, plasma generated by microwave may become more homogeneous, and the pressure inside a processing chamber may be reduced. By optimizing the shape of the containment shield, the lifetime of metastable radical species may be increased. One aspect of extending the lifetime of metastable radical species is to allow better control of chemical reaction and thus help achieve the desired film properties. For an array of antennas, the containment shield comprises a dielectric coated metal base with dividers between the antennas. The divider comprises a dielectric material or a mixture of a dielectric layer and a dielectric coated metal layer, and allows coupling among the antennas. Such a dielectric coated metal containment shield may be easier to be manufactured at lower cost than a containment shield comprising only dielectric material such as quartz.\n\nInventors:  STOWELL; Michael W.; (Loveland, CO)\n\n5.

With the assistance of the microwave source, the sputtering target is able to operate at a lower pressure, a lower voltage and may yield higher deposition rates than without the microwave source. The target may have a generally circular or rectangular cross section. The microstrip may be of a curved strip such as a ring shape or a straight strip, depending upon the shape of the sputtering target.\n\nInventors:  Stowell; Michael W.; (Loveland, CO)\n\n6.

A probe, such as a pyrometer, is disposed in an opening of a vacuum chamber adjacent a radiation transparent window. The probe defines an optical path which intercepts the radiant object entering or exiting a processing chamber. The radiant object is moved through the optical path and emits electromagnetic waves. The electromagnetic waves are collected by the probe and transmitted to a signal processing unit where the waves are detected and converted to a temperature reading. If desired, the accumulated data may then be used to generate a cooling curve representing the thermal effects experienced by the radiant object. Extrapolation or correlation methods may be used to extend the cooling curve to points in time prior to or after the data collected by the probe.\n\nInventors:  Das; Ashok (Sunnyvale, CA), Krishna; Nety (Sunnyvale, CA), Schweitzer; Marc (San Jose, CA), Patadia; Nalin (Campbell, CA), Yang; Wei (Fremont, CA), Kelkar; Umesh (Sunnyvale, CA), Parkhe; Vijay (Sunnyvale, CA), Petitt; Scot (Sunnyvale, CA), Khurana; Nitin (Santa Clara, CA) ', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', ''),

Firstly, scalability of inverted T\nshaped FG is evaluated by 3D electrostatics simulation. It is shown that coupling ratio (CR) and\nFloating Gate Interference (FGI) performance can be maintained at the level of 34nm technology\ndown to 13nm node by engineering key aspects of the FG shape namely FG top width (FGW) and\neffective field height (EFH) in addition to conventional scaling approaches of IPD thinning and\nspacer k reduction. Secondly, FG shaping is demonstrated down to FGW of 3nm and EFH of 5nm\nusing a sacrificial oxidation technology with no bird''s beak to demonstrate fabrication feasibility.\n\nHydrogen storage property of sandwiched magnesium hydride nanoparticle thin #lm\nInternational Journal of Hydrogen Energy May 14, 2010\nAuthors: Matt Rogers, Steven Barcelo, Costas Grigoropoulos, Samuel Mao\nHydrogen sorption property of magnesium (Mg) in the form of sandwiched Pd/Mg/Pd films is\ninvestigated. Pulsed laser deposition method was applied to deposit the samples consisting of films\nof nanoparticles. The enthalpy of formation of MgH2 was found to be #68 kJ/mol H2 for films with\nnanoparticle size on the order of 50 nm, which is smaller than the value for bulk MgH2 and may be\nexplained by the concept of excess volume.\n\nHydrogen storage characteristics of nanograined free-standing magnesium–nickel films\nAPPLIED PHYSICS A: MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING April 11, 2009\nAuthors: Matt Rogers, Steven Barcelo, Costas Grigoropoulos, Sam Mao, Gang Chen, Mildred S.\nDresselhaus\nFree-standing magnesium–nickel (Mg–Ni) films with extensive nanoscale grain structures were\nfabricated using a combination of pulsed laser deposition and film delaminating processes.\nHydrogen sorption and desorption properties of the films, free from the influence of substrates,\nwere investigated. Oxidation of the material was reduced through the use of a sandwiched\nfree-standing film structure in which the top and bottom layers consist of nanometer-thick Pd layers,\nwhich also acted as a catalyst to promote hydrogen uptake and release. Hydrogen storage\ncharacteristics were studied at three temperatures, 296, 232, and 180°C, where multiple\nsorption/desorption cycles were measured gravimetrically. An improvement in hydrogen storage\ncapacity over the bulk Mg–Ni target material was found for the free-standing films. As shown from a\nVan’t Hoff plot, the thermodynamic stability of the nanograined films is similar to that of Mg2Ni.\nThese results suggest that free-standing films, of which better control of material compositions and\nmicrostructures can be realized than is possible for conventional ball-milled powders, represent a\nuseful materials platform for solid-state hydrogen storage research.\n\nAbsence of amorphous phase in high power femtosecond laser-ablated silicon\nApplied Physics Letters January 8, 2009\nAuthors: Matt Rogers, Costas Grigoropoulos, Andrew Minor, Samuel Mao\nAs femtosecond lasers emerge as viable tools for advanced microscale materials processing, it\nbecomes increasingly important to understand the characteristics of materials resulting from\nfemtosecond laser microablation or micromachining. We conducted transmission electron\nmicroscopy experiments to investigate crater structures in silicon produced by repetitive high power\nfemtosecond laser ablation. Comparable experiments of nanosecond laser ablation of silicon were\nalso performed. We found that an amorphous silicon layer that is typically produced in nanosecond\nlaser ablation is absent when the material is irradiated by high power femtosecond laser pulses.\nInstead, only a defective single crystalline layer was observed in the high power femtosecond\nlaser-ablated silicon crater. Possible mechanisms underlying the formation of the defective single\ncrystalline phase are discussed.\n\nZnO nanowire network transistor fabrication on a polymer substrate by low-temperature,\nall-inorganic nanoparticle solution process\nApplied Physics Letters April 15, 2008\nAuthors: Matt Rogers, Seunghwan Ko, Nipun Misra, Heng Pan, Costas Grigoropoulos, Albert\nPisano\nAll-solution processed, low-temperature zinc oxide nanowire network transistor fabrication on a\npolymer substrate was demonstrated. This simple process can produce high resolution metal\nelectrode transistors with inorganic semiconductor nanowire active material in a fully maskless\nsequence, eliminating the need for lithographic and vacuum processes. The temperature\nthroughout the processing was under 140 °C, which will enable further applications to electronics on\nlow-cost, large-area flexible polymer substrates.\n\nPulsed Laser Annealing of Semiconductor Structures for Functional Devices\nPhysica Status Solidi (c) July 15, 2008\nAuthors: Matt Rogers, Nipun Misra, Sherry Li Xu, Costas Grigoropoulos, Seunghwan Ko\nWe review our progress on the laser processing of semiconductor microstructures and\nnanostructures for functional devices. Fundamental research conducted to understand the\nmelt-mediated phase transformations induced by nanosecond laser irradiation in thin\nsemiconductor films is presented. A detailed experimental study analyzed the physical mechanisms\nof the explosive crystallization in amorphous germanium that produces large area self-sustained\ncrystal growth. The double laser crystallization method that combines a nanosecond laser pulse\nand a modulated microsecond laser beam was shown to produce ultra-large grain polycrystalline\nsilicon, enabling fabrication of thin film transistor devices of high performance from amorphous\nsilicon films. The crystal growth process was imaged by temporally resolved photography. Non-melt\nExcimer Laser annealing of thin silicon-on-insulator films for dopant activation was demonstrated.\nApplying multiple laser pulses below the melting threshold effected solid phase annealing of the\nsingle crystalline silicon films. Semiconductor nanowires are one-dimensional nanostructures that\nhave displayed the potential to be used with low-cost flexible plastic substrates for applications\nsuch as large-area displays and sensor arrays. The excimer laser annealing of silicon nanowires is\ndemonstrated as an alternative to conventional thermal annealing for dopant activation. The optical\nabsorption of the nanowires is discussed and the effect of parameters such as fluence and number\nof pulses is investigated. The interaction of laser pulses with silicon nanowires is investigated\nthrough numerical simulations\n\nExplosive Crystallization in the Presence of Melting\nPhysical Review B May 2006\nAuthors: Matt Rogers, Costas Grigoropoulos, Seunghwan Ko\nAn experimental investigation of explosive crystallization ##EC## of thin amorphous Ge #lms\ndeposited on a solid substrate is performed, and a theory of EC front propagation accompanied by melting in a\nclass of #lms that includes Ge #lms is developed. The experiments show that the propagation of a planar EC\nfront is possible for a certain range of substrate temperatures and #lm thicknesses. It is found that for substrate\ntemperatures larger than a certain threshold, the macroscopically planar front leaves behind a columnar\nmicrostructure in the crystal. The theory of EC front propagation is based on the experimental observation that the propagating front exhibits a thin layer of Ge melt between the amorphous and crystalline phases. A uniformly propagating planar front solution is determined, whose propagation speed is found as a function of the substrate temperature and the heat loss parameter that, in turn, depends on the #lm thickness. A linear stability analysis of the uniformly propagating EC front with a melting layer is performed. It is found that in a certain interval of substrate temperatures the EC front undergoes a monotonic morphological instability with a preferred wave number that explains the formation of the columnar structures observed in experiments. We also perform a nonlinear analysis describing the evolution of the morphological instability. The interval of substrate\ntemperatures for which the instability is observed, as well as the wavelength of the columnar structure, are found to be in good agreement with experimental observations.\n\nPatents\nMETHODS OF FORMING OXIDE LAYERS ON SUBSTRATES\nUnited States Patent Application 20100330814\nInventors: Matt Rogers\nMethods for processing substrates are provided herein.
